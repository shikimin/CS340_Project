# Catopia - A Cat Hotel Management System

## Introduction
Welcome to Catopia, an upscale, 5-star resort and hotel for cats. An estimated 2000 customers leave their beloved feline companions at this esteemed establishment when they are away from home for an extended period. In addition to the top-of-the-line care that is provided for every cat during their reservation, customers can purchase extra services such as grooming, gourmet meal packages, and quality play time for them as well. 

As Catopia thrives, welcoming an impressive 20% increase in our customer base and a substantial 30% growth in the number of cat guests enjoying extended stays in just the last year, the complexity of their operation has expanded. This exciting growth introduces new challenges: handling more cat visits, balancing resources. The expanding need for an efficient and performance-tracking database system to navigate this growing business landscape is evident. 

This system manages customer and cat data, keeping track of reservation details like time, cost, profits, services purchased, and service performance. It helps Catopia to manage its growing customer base and enhance its services, ensuring that every cat continues to receive the highest standard of care.
